# bot_1369
a fun bot to tweet insults at your friends!

In the table 'Users' in the database provided, add each of your friends you want to troll, then make sure the program randomly generates the right number of possible users so each one gets made fun of! The bot has 60 insults and more will be added as time goes on. Make sure that you register your app with twitter and use your cridentials to make the bot come to life. You will have to download Tweepy for it to run! This is meant to have fun with your friends and in no way is to be used against people who don't know the bot is to be taken as a joke. I recomend you go through each of the jokes and edit them as you see fit. /FtGoG/


The bot creates its own insults via the sentence structure designed by @MattHofstadt and is showcased on the website http://intellisult.com/. This sentence structure is :

name / is a(n) / (-ly) adj / (past tense) adj / noun / and a(n) / adj / adj & verb (sorta) / noun
